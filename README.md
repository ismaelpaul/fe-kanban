## Overview

### Kanban Task Management app with real-time updates via WebSockets.

Front-end stack:

- **TypeScript** and **React**;
- **Tailwind** CSS for styling;
- **Zustand** for global state management;
- **Cypress** for testing.

As a user, you can:

- Register, log in and log out;
- Create a team, edit it, and (soon) invite users to join â€” the latter feature is currently under development;
- Create boards for a team, then edit and/or delete them;
- Create columns for a board, then edit and/or delete them;
- Create tasks for a column, then view its details, edit it, delete it, mark as complete, drag and drop tasks between columns and/or add comments to the task;
- Create subtasks for the tasks and mark them as complete;
- Toggle between light and dark mode .
